  "quote": "When the Grafton Historical Society started in 2016, we needed a web presence. But as a new non-profit organization, we did not have any funds. As we searched for non-profit support services, we found Free for Charity. Free for Charity was able to provide and setup our domain and web site builder at no cost for us. The sign-up process was easy and I was able to create and publish our site right away. When I needed help, the Free for Charity team was always there to assist me. A year later, we still rely on Free for Charity and we use the funds we save towards the preservation of history for Grafton, Wisconsin."
