His service to the team continues to be vital to the growth of the team. He uses his knowledge and expertise to teach our young programmers what they need to be successful in our program and beyond. His work with Free for Charity has also benefited the team in many ways, including the donation of several computers to the team. I rely on his knowledge of non-profit organizations and the community as well as his technical ability constantly."
