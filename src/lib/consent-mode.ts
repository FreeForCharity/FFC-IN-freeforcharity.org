// Google Consent Mode v2 defaults.
//
// Policy: every storage type that carries measurement or personalisation is
// DENIED by default for every visitor, worldwide, until they opt in. There is
// no regional carve-out and no permissive default.
//
// Precisely, because the precision is the whole point of this block:
// analytics_storage, ad_storage, ad_user_data, ad_personalization and
// personalization_storage all start denied. security_storage is granted and
// stays granted. functionality_storage is granted BY DEFAULT — a site that
// cannot remember a consent choice cannot honour one — and thereafter follows
// the visitor's own functional toggle through updateGoogleConsent, so it is
// not something that "stays" granted.
//
// This summary has been wrong twice, in opposite directions. It first read
// "storage is DENIED" flat, which over-claimed by ignoring the two granted
// types; correcting that to "analytics and advertising" under-claimed by
// dropping personalization_storage, and kept a "stays granted" the update
// call contradicts. Summarising a list is a claim about every item in it.
//
// Google's EU User Consent Policy only *requires* opt-in for the EEA, the
// UK and Switzerland, but applying that treatment selectively would mean
// deciding, on the site owner's behalf, that its other visitors get weaker
// protection. Each charity is the controller for its own site, so the
// stricter setting is the default; a charity that wants something else can
// choose it deliberately.
//
// What this means at runtime. The Google tags still LOAD on every visit —
// what is withheld is permission to use storage:
//
//   - Before consent, anywhere → analytics_storage and every ad signal are
//                                denied. GA4 sends COOKIELESS pings, so
//                                pageviews are modeled in aggregate rather
//                                than lost, and no identifier is set or
//                                read.
//   - After an explicit accept → `consent update` flips storage to granted
//                                and normal cookie-based measurement
//                                begins.
//
// Note what this is NOT: it is not "no requests to Google until consent".
// The tags load and ping cookielessly in the denied state. That is Google's
// documented denied-state behaviour and the reason Consent Mode preserves
// aggregate measurement at all. A site wanting zero contact with Google
// before consent has to not load the tag, which is a different design.
//
// NON-Google scripts do not speak Consent Mode, so they are gated the only
// way they can be: Microsoft Clarity loads only on an explicit analytics
// grant and the Meta Pixel only on an explicit marketing grant.
//
// `wait_for_update` holds tags briefly so a returning visitor's stored
// choice is applied before the first hit fires, instead of the hit going
// out as denied and the consent arriving a beat too late.

 * permissive-outside-the-EEA policy. Both the region array and the grant
 * are gone: a single unscoped denial applies to everyone, and there is no
 * longer any region for Google to resolve from the visitor's IP.
 *
 * `url_passthrough` keeps click ids flowing through navigation while
 * cookies are denied, and `ads_data_redaction` strips ad identifiers while
 * `ad_storage` is denied. Under a global denial both matter on every visit
 * rather than only in the EEA.
